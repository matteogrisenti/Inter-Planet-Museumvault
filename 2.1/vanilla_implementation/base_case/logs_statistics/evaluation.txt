|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Low is better. A massive number here (millions) suggests                        |
|                             |             | your "Vanilla" strategy is creating too many explicit states.                                  |

|    - Auxiliary Atoms        | 922         | Helper facts generated during the process.                                                     |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Proportional to relevant atoms. Sudden spikes indicate                          |
|                             |             | inefficient predicate definitions.                                                             |

|    - Translator Variables   | 50          | The planner compressed your 1117 atoms into 50 multi-valued variables.                         |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Excellent. The ratio (1117 -> 50) shows the translator                          |

|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Higher is often better; it means the solver found                               |
|                             |             | logical constraints it can use to prune the search.                                            |

|    - Operators Removed      | 0           | Actions deemed impossible to execute from the initial state.                                   |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: "0" is perfect. It means all your defined actions are                           |
|                             |             | theoretically reachable. High numbers here indicate bugs in preconditions.                     |
|                             |             |                                                                                                |

|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Small numbers are normal cleanup.                                               |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4. Operator Generation      |             | THE "SCALING" BOTTLENECK                                                                       |
|    - Translator Operators   | 692         | The final count of specific executable actions (e.g., "pick-up-drill-hall-a").                 |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: This is the most critical metric for your strategy.                             |
|                             |             | 692 is very efficient. If this number explodes (e.g., >100,000) when                           |
|                             |             | adding objects, your "Vanilla" strategy needs to switch to ADL features.                       |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5. Performance Resources    |             | THE "COST" CHECK                                                                               |
|    - Translator Task Size   | 5732        | The file size of the converted problem (SAS+).                                                 |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Small footprint.                                                                |

|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Negligible. You have massive headroom to scale up.                              |
|                             |             |                                                                                                |
|    - Total Time             | 0.127s      | Wall-clock time to finish translation.                                                         |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Instant.                                                                        |

|    - Graph Status           | Not Acyclic | Describes the dependency web between variables (e.g., location affects hands).                 |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: "Not acyclic" is standard and correct for robot domains.                        |

|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: 100% (50/50) is excellent. It means your domain definition                      |
|                             |             | is "tight." You have no "dead" state variables that waste memory.                              |
|                             |             |                                                                                                |

|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Dropping a few (4) is normal optimization.                                      |

|                             |             | (e.g., moving from A to B) are mathematically simple assignments.                              |
|                             |             | This is a major reason why your Heuristic Search is so fast.                                   |

|    - Plan Length            | 126 steps   | Total number of actions in the solution.                                                       |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: High/Verbose. This is the trade-off of "Vanilla" PDDL.                          |
|                             |             | Because you use explicit actions for everything (e.g., "activate-seal"                         |
|                             |             | every single time), the plan is long. A more complex domain might do                           |
|                             |             | these automatically (0 steps), but would search slower.                                        |
|                             |             |                                                                                                |
|    - Plan Cost              | 126         | Sum of action costs (all actions = 1 cost here).                                               |

| 3. Non-Determinism Handling |             | THE "SAFETY" CHECK                                                                             |
|    - Strong Cyclic Plan     | True        | Means the solution is guaranteed to succeed eventually, even if the                            |
|                             |             | seismic room fails 100 times in a row. It has a "loop" to retry.                               |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: Success. The planner correctly identified that if entering                      |
|                             |             | Hall-B fails, it should just try again.                                                        |
|                             |             |                                                                                                |
|    - Policy Score           | 1           | A metric of policy quality/robustness.                                                         |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: "1" usually indicates a valid solution was found that                           |
|                             |             | covers the expected outcomes.                                                                  |

| 4. Simulation & Verification|             | THE "REALITY" CHECK                                                                            |
|    - Successful States      | 136         | The simulator ran the plan and hit the goal in 136 steps.                                      |
|                             |             | -> NOTE: This is slightly higher than the "Plan Length" (126) because                          |
|                             |             | the simulator likely encountered a few "failed" seismic checks and                             |
|                             |             | had to retry, which is exactly what a strong cyclic plan is for.                               |
|                             |             |                                                                                                |
|    - Replans                | 0           | Did the robot have to stop and think of a NEW plan during execution?                           |
|                             |             | -> EVALUATION: 0 is perfect. The initial policy covered all contingencies.                     |
