                                 VERDICT
================================================================================
The "Heavy Case" (Batch 2) reveals the limits of the Vanilla strategy:

1. Translation is SAFE: Memory and Operator count are scaling linearly.
   Your modeling of objects is efficient.

2. Search is STRESSING: The state space is exploding (3k -> 9k -> 23k).
   The "Core Drills" (Batch 2) are significantly harder than the "Bio Samples"
   (Batch 1) because they force the robot to visit 3 locations per item.

3. Prediction for Batch 3: If you enable Batch 3 (Seismic Nightmare),
   expect "Generated States" to exceed 60,000+ and "Plan Length" to hit 500+.
