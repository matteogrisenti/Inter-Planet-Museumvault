                                 VERDICT
================================================================================
The "Base + Batch 1" test passed easily.
1. Scalability: The "Vanilla" strategy is currently scaling LINEARLY in memory
   (Translation) but showing early signs of POLYNOMIAL growth in search effort
   (States generated tripled).
2. Performance: 0.32s total time is still instantaneous for a human user.
3. Next Step: Batch 2 (Heavy Cores) will likely stress the plan length and
   search depth more than Batch 1 did.
