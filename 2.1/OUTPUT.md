# PRP Planner Output Documentation

This document describes the files automatically generated by the **PRP (Planner for Relevant Policies)** execution for Non-Deterministic planning problems.

## 📂 File Structure

After running the planner, you will find the following files in your working directory. Here is a breakdown of their purpose:

### 🏆 Core Output (The Solution)
* **`sas_plan`**
    * **Description:** This is the most important file. It contains the final plan (or linearized policy) found by the planner.
    * **Format:** Plain text containing a sequential list of actions (e.g., `(move-to-room curator hall-a)`).
    * **Usage:** Use this file to visualize the solution, validate it, or feed it into a simulator.

### ⚙️ Intermediate Pipeline Files
These files are produced by the various stages of the Fast Downward/PRP pipeline and serve as input for subsequent stages.

* **`output.sas`**
    * **Generated by:** `translate.py` (The Translator)
    * **Description:** The problem representation in SAS+ format (Finite-Domain Representation). It converts the logical predicates of PDDL into finite-state (numerical) variables that are easier for the algorithm to process.

* **`output`**
    * **Generated by:** `preprocess` (The Preprocessor)
    * **Description:** An optimized and "cleaned" version of `output.sas`.
    * **Details:** The preprocessor removes unnecessary variables and static actions, and simplifies the causal graph to make the search faster. This is the actual file read by the search engine.

### 📊 Logs & Statistics
Files useful for benchmarking and performance analysis.

* **`elapsed.time`**
    * **Description:** Records the time taken (in seconds) by each of the three phases:
        1.  Translation
        2.  Preprocessing
        3.  Search
    * **Usage:** Useful for performance reports or comparing different heuristics.

* **`plan_numbers_and_cost`**
    * **Description:** Usually contains two numerical values:
        1.  Plan ID/Index.
        2.  Total plan cost (often corresponds to the number of actions if specific costs are not defined).

## PRP Pipeline Summary
The execution flow that generated these files is as follows:
* **Input**: *domain.pddl + problem.pddl*
* **Translate**: Reads PDDL -> Generates *output.sas*
* **Preprocess**: Reads *output.sas* -> Generates *output*
* **Search (PRP)**: Reads *output* -> Generates *sas_plan*
